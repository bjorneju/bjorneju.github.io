abstract: "This project aimed to acquire theoretical and computational tools for analyzing causal interactions in complex networks within the framework of Integrated Information Theory (IIT). The work was carried out during a research visit to the laboratory of Giulio Tononi, under the primary supervision of Larissa Albantakis, one of the main developers of IIT’s mathematical formalism. The project focused on learning to apply IIT’s causal analysis framework to evolving artificial agents (“animats”) with Boolean network nervous systems, evolved via genetic algorithms in simulated environments. By applying IIT-inspired causal analysis to evolving artificial agents, the project examined the extent to which an agent’s actions are driven by internal network dynamics versus external sensory inputs. Using adaptive agents equipped with small Markov Brains, evolved under varying sensor capacities and task demands, the work quantified the actual causes of actions and traced their causal histories over time. The results showed that the degree to which behavior was internally caused—rather than environmentally driven—systematically depended on task difficulty and sensor constraints, highlighting how intrinsic causal structure adapts to environmental demands. These findings formed the basis of a peer-reviewed conference paper and an oral presentation at the Artificial Life (ALIFE) conference, and provided a concrete demonstration of how causal analysis frameworks developed in IIT can be used to study autonomy, agency, and internal control in complex adaptive systems."
