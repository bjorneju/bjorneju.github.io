abstract: "Background Developing and testing methods for reliably assessing states of consciousness in humans is important for both basic research and clinical purposes. Several potential measures, partly grounded in theoretical developments, have been proposed, and some of them seem to reliably distinguish between conscious and unconscious brain states. However, the degrees to which these measures may also be affected by changes in brain activity or conditions that can occur within conscious brain states have rarely been tested. In this study we test whether several of these measures are modulated by attentional load and related use of cognitive resources. Methods We recorded EEG from 12 participants while they passively received three types of stimuli: (1) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses (for measuring perturbational complexity), (2) auditory stimuli (for detection of auditory pattern deviants), or (3) audible clicks from a clock (spontaneous EEG, for measures of signal diversity and functional connectivity). We investigated whether the measures significantly differed between the passive condition and a attentional and cognitively demanding working memory task. Results Our results showed that in the attention-based auditory P3b ERP measure (global auditory pattern deviant) was significantly affected by increased attentional and cognitive load, while the various measures based on spontaneous and perturbed EEG were not affected. Conclusion Measures of conscious state based on complexity, diversity, and effective connectivity, are not affected by attentional and cognitive load, suggesting that these measures can be used to test both for the presence and absence of consciousness."
excerpt: "In this manuscript we show how certain proposed measures of consciousness, based on EEG activity, are (not) affected by the attentional load an individual is undergoing during the measurements. This was important to understand which measures are sensitive to attentional or cognitive resources, rather than the level of consciousness."
