title: "Exploring the Clinical Integration of BCI Technology in General Anesthesia Monitoring"
collection: "publications"
category: "workshops"
abstract: "This workshop will explore the state-of-the-art applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) in general anesthesia monitoring. BCIs offer the potential to improve patient care by providing direct neural feedback, giving clinicians real-time insights into brain activity during anesthesia through EEG-based tools to monitor awareness and the depth of anesthesia. We will focus on integrating BCIs in clinical settings, emphasizing how they can enhance anesthesia precision and enable more individualized care. Following brief introductions and discussions of relevant research methodologies and empirical findings (i.e., neural markers of awareness, machine learning tools, experimental protocols to study depth of anesthesia, etc.), we aim to open a dialogue on the implications of BCIs in the operating room and their potential to transform general anesthesia practice. In particular, better monitoring through BCIs could significantly reduce the incidence of intraoperative awareness, a rare but serious complication where patients regain consciousness during surgery. Participants will gain an understanding of the technical challenges, ethical considerations, and potential clinical benefits of employing BCIs for anesthesia monitoring. The workshop will provide a platform for cross-disciplinary discussion, inviting contributions from experts in neurotechnology, anesthesiology, and clinical practice to advance the state of knowledge in this rapidly evolving field."
