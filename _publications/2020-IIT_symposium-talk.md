title: "Open symposium on scientific theories of consciousness: Integrated Information Theory"
collection: "publications"
category: "workshops"
abstract: "After decades of progress in cognitive neuroscience, consciousness still eludes our understanding. Are scientific theories of consciousness even possible? If so, how close have we gotten so far? This symposium event will entertain these questions through the lens of integrated information theory (IIT), a leading theory of consciousness. First, the theory and its development will be put in historical context and the fundamentals of IIT introduced. Next, we will explain how the general approach of IIT sets it apart from other theories and how IIT has inspired clinically useful tools and applications. We will end with a panel discussion and audience Q&A covering IIT and consciousness more broadly.
