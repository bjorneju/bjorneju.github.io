abstract: "Background
There is a strong tradition for withdrawing medical equipment from patients receiving end-of-life (EOL) care. However, the introduction of new noninvasive medical equipment could be acceptable provided that it improves the quality of care and patient comfort.

Objectives
We aimed to systematically map published studies of the perspectives, attitudes and experiences of health care professionals, dying patients, and their next of kin, about introducing noninvasive medical technology in end-of-life care.

Design
We conducted a scoping review. On January 27, 2025, systematic searches of five databases were carried out (Medline (EBSCO), CINAHL, Embase, Academic Search Elite, and Cochrane Library CDSR). Inclusion criteria were empirical studies published in English or Scandinavian languages. We searched for qualitative, quantitative or mixed method studies focusing on perspectives on, experiences of and attitudes toward introducing noninvasive medical technologies in end-of-life care from the view of health care professionals, dying patients, and their next of kin. Three pairs of researchers independently assessed potential eligibility and data extraction. Data would be summarized qualitatively.

Results
The searches yielded 3288 unique articles, 3194 of which were excluded following an initial screening. Among the remaining 94 articles, none satisfied our inclusion criteria. Thus, we found no empirical articles addressing perspectives on, attitudes toward, or experiences with the use of noninvasive medical technology in end-of-life care.

Conclusions
Empirical research exploring the perspectives on, attitudes toward, and experiences of, and use of noninvasive medical technology in end-of-life care is needed. This is important for understanding when and how it is feasible, useful, and ethical to introduce such technologies in the terminal phase of palliative care."
