title: "Understanding Consciousness: A scientific Quest for the 21st Century"
collection: "publications"
category: "workshops"
abstract: "How does our subjective experience emerge from the brain? How does consciousness relate to the physical world? Where does consciousness arise? These questions are currently of great interest for neuroscience worldwide. The Human Brain Project (HBP) is organising a conference gathering world-leading experts in this area of consciousness research.
The conference will focus on fundamentals and theory, computational models, and clinical-societal implications of consciousness research. As society needs to be scientifically and culturally prepared to face the emerging questions on consciousness, an approach with the broadest scope is needed; diverse theoretical frameworks, brain anatomy, physiology, and chemistry across scales and species, detailed and large-scale computer simulations, deep learning, neuromorphic computing, robotics, clinical neurology, anaesthesiology, psychology, behavioural, computational, and philosophical analysis must interact and blend on a single infrastructure."
