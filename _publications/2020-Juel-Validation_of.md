abstract: "We test whether a measure based on the directed transfer function (DTF) calculated from short segments of electroencephalography (EEG) time-series can be used to monitor the state of the patients also during sevoflurane anesthesia as it can for patients undergoing propofol anesthesia. We collected and analyzed 25-channel EEG from 7 patients (3 females, ages 41–56 years) undergoing surgical anesthesia with sevoflurane, and quantified the sensor space directed connectivity for every 1-s epoch using DTF. The resulting connectivity parameters were compared to corresponding parameters from our previous study (n = 8, patients anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil, but otherwise using a similar protocol). Statistical comparisons between and within studies were done using permutation statistics, a data driven algorithm based on the DTF-parameters was employed to classify the epochs as coming from awake or anesthetized state. According to results of the permutation tests, DTF-parameter topographies were significantly different between the awake and anesthesia state at the group level. However, the topographies were not significantly different when comparing results computed from sevoflurane and propofol data, neither in the awake nor in anesthetized state. Optimizing the algorithm for simultaneously having high sensitivity and specificity in classification yielded an accuracy of 95.1% (SE = 0.96%), with sensitivity of 98.4% (SE = 0.80%) and specificity of 94.8% (SE = 0.10%). These findings indicate that the DTF changes in a similar manner when humans undergo general anesthesia caused by two distinct anesthetic agents with different molecular mechanisms of action."
