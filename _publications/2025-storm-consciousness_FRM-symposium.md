title: "Progress in Consciousness Research: A Multiscale Integrative Approach"
collection: "publications"
category: "workshops"
abstract: "This symposium will present diverse examples from the recent surge in neuroscientific consciousness research, across multiple levels, from subcellular, neuronal mechanisms to systems neuroscience and computational approaches. While various research approaches often address different aspects or mechanistic levels of consciousness, they may contribute complementary elements to a more complete understanding of the properties, nature, and origin of conscious experience. The presentations will discuss subcellular mechanisms of reportable sensory perception and unconsciousness induced by general anesthesia, computational approached to consciousness, and an adversarial collaboration for testing contrasting predictions from different theories of consciousness.
