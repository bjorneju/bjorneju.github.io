abstract: "Can we know whether someone is conscious by looking solely at the activity of their brain? If so, what is it about the patterns of their brain activity that is particular for when they are having some conscious experience? Perhaps there are markers in the brain activity that are always observable when someone is conscious, but that are never observable when they are unconscious? In an attempt to answer such questions, we obtained measurements of electrical brain activity from patients and healthy volunteers in both conscious and unconscious states. Using these measurements, we tried to find particular markers in the recorded brain activity that differed predictably between conscious and unconscious states, and that could be used to precisely and objectively classify individuals as conscious or unconscious. We found that several of the markers we tested could be used to accurately classify the state of consciousness in patients and healthy controls. Hopefully, the work presented here will become useful for tools for objective monitoring of the conscious state in patients, and be informative for expanding our scientific understanding of the phenomenon consciousness. Our research was funded by grants from the Norwegian Research Council (NRC: 262950/F20 and 214079/F20) and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Specific Grant Agreement No. 720270 (Human Brain Project SGA1) and 785907 (Human Brain Project SGA2))." 
excerpt: "Can we know whether someone is conscious by looking solely at the activity of their brain? If so, what is it about the patterns of activity in someone’s brain that is particular for when they arehaving some conscious experience? Perhaps there is some marker in the brain activity that is always observable when someone is conscious, but that is never observable they are unconscious? In this thesis, and in the work leading up to it, we have tried to answer questions like these. 
In our struggle to do so, we obtained recordings of electrical brain activity from patients and healthy volunteers in both conscious states (for example normal wakefulness or while dreaming) and unconscious states (for example under general anesthesia sufficient for surgery). Within the brain activity recordings, we tried to find particular properties that differed predictably between conscious and unconscious states, and that could be used to precisely and objectively classify individuals as conscious or unconscious. Thus, we have been looking for electrophysiological markers of consciousness. Following emerging trends in empirical findings over the last few decades, as well as theoreticalconsiderations about the phenomenon of consciousness, we focused our investigations on properties of connectivity, complexity, and signal diversity in the brain activity data. We quantified these properties using specific mathematical measures, and investigated which of the measures could be used to accurately classify individuals as conscious and unconscious. The ground truth about anindividual’s (lack of) consciousness was taken to be their own report when available. And if such a report was not available, the judgement of a third party using standardized behavioral scores was used to define their conscious state.
Several of the measures we tested could be used to accurately classify the state of consciousness in patients and healthy controls. Apparently, they could even distinguish between states with and without reports of vivid dreams during anesthesia induced unresponsiveness. However, some of the measures were also affected by changes that are not necessarily related to the presence of consciousness as such. For example, closing one's eyes, while otherwise awake and aware, was sufficient to significantly alter certain measures of signal diversity to values closer to what is normally associated with unconscious states. That said, even though the potential markers of consciousness in their current form may not specifically track consciousness as such, and further work is required to improve them, we believe that some of them may become useful as future tools for objective, real-time monitoring of the conscious state in patients. Hopefully, the work required for their further development will also lead to new insights moving our scientific understanding of the phenomenon consciousness forward."
