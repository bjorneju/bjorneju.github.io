abstract: "The target article misrepresents the foundations of integrated information theory (IIT) and ignores many essential publications. It, thus, falls to this lead commentary to outline the axioms and postulates of IIT and correct major misconceptions. The commentary also explains why IIT starts from phenomenology and why it predicts that only select physical substrates can support consciousness. Finally, it highlights that IIT's account of experience – a cause–effect structure quantified by integrated information – has nothing to do with “information transfer.”"
excerpt: "In this commentary, we argue that the target article (criticizing IIT) did not in fact criticize IIT as we know it, but rather the target article authors' rendition of the theory."
