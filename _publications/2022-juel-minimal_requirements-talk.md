title: "Minimal requirements for scientific theories of consciousness"
collection: "publications"
category: "workshops"
abstract: "A general problem that hinders progress in our field is the lack of consensus on what would count as scientific explanation of consciousness. A solution to this could be to find a set of minimal explanatory and methodological requirements for satisfactory scientific theories of consciousness (ST). We propose an initial set of such requirements, argue for the necessity of each requirement, and invite attendees to discuss how the list may be amended.

The explanatory requirements are; 
(i) Presence/absence of experience; ST must explain and predict whether or not a physical system (including non-neural, non-biological systems) is having a conscious experience in a given moment, and provide reasons for why any proposed measurable property accounts for the presence/absence of experience; 
(ii) Content of experience; ST must explain and predict what it is like to be any conscious system, provide a one-to-one mapping between phenomenology and measurable properties of a system, explain how subsystems contribute to the content of experience (e.g. contributing visual experience, tactile experience, etc.), and why those subsystems contribute that content rather than other contents; 

The methodological requirements are; 
(iii) Start from, and end with, phenomenology; ST must be grounded in properties of the experience itself, allow for using first-person data (gathered from subjective report, introspection, self-reflection, etc.), and provide an explanation for the subjective aspects of consciousness rather than functions or physical properties that accompany them; 
(iv) Behavior/stimulus independent; ST must measure the properties that account for experience in a way that does not rely solely on behavior / stimuli to determine the presence or contents of experience; 
(v) Validation in undisputed cases; ST must be validated in conditions where both the presence and content of the subject’s consciousness are undisputed and accessible via subjective report (e.g. in awake healthy human subjects in a natural setting); 
(vi) Falsifiable; ST must in principle be falsifiable, at least in conditions where both the presence and contents of the subject’s consciousness are undisputed.
