I am a teacher and research scientist, with a background in physics and neuroscience, currently studying consciousness. 
Navigating the pages on this site, you should be able to find some information about my academic past, present, and future. But to get you started, the cards below can take you to some tangible results of my work. 

Hope you find something you enjoy, and please feel free to get in touch!
