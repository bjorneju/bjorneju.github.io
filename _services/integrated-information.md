tagline: "Hands-on workshop exploring IIT, causal analysis, and multidimensional data in consciousness research"

excerpt: >
  Interactive workshops for researchers and teams aiming to understand and apply
  Integrated Information Theory (IIT), causal modeling, and complex data
  analysis to neuroscience and consciousness studies.

audience: >
  Academic labs, interdisciplinary research teams, and students interested
  in advanced neuroscience methods, consciousness theory, and complex systems.

includes:
  - Introductory and advanced sessions on IIT and its application to empirical data
  - Hands-on exercises with multidimensional datasets (EEG, imaging, or simulations)
  - Practical guidance on causal analysis in complex brain systems
  - Discussion of linking theoretical models to experimental design
  - Written materials and interactive problem-solving during the workshop
  - Optional follow-up sessions for project-specific guidance
